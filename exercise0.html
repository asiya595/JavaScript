        It’s so fluffy! Here’s a quick picture guide of the ​top small, medium, and big​ fluffy dog breeds, along with some breed info to help you get started with your perfect fuzzy companion. 
        ​Havanese have the biggest heart of all, and they’re absolutely in love with you.
         <h2>Type:</h2>This is the epitome of a lapdog as they’re glued to your side and looking for a warm spot to nap at all times.
        ​They’re quite adaptable to your lifestyle, ​but Havanese do not like being left alone and may bark and howl while you’re gone, which may make them difficult apartment dogs. They can be overly timid, but some early training and socialization can help curb their anxiety.
      <h2>Groom:</h2>  Grooming Can Make All The Difference
​With ​most breeds, the best way to maximize ​your dog’s fluffiness is ​simply done with proper grooming and maintenance. 
Most often this means growing their coat out, and keeping up with ​daily brushing to fluff out their coat.
 <h2>Brushing:</h2>A good slicker brush will actually increase the fluffy look by separating individual hairs, while removing mats and tangles. 
 They can be described as confident, curious, and enjoy being treated like a prince (or princess).
Poms are a perfect accomplice to go on adventures with, as they enjoy spending their days following you around and genuinely enjoy new experiences. 
<h2>Sensitive:</h2>Just keep in mind they’re sensitive to heat and need to cool off every so often. 
Their fluffy coat needs daily maintenance and brushing, and they can shed an impressive amount of hair for a small critter.
